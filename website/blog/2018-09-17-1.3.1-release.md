1.3.x release comes with a couple important changes. All changes are not breaking, but here are a couple of things you should now before upgrade.

<!--truncate-->

## @babel 7
`babel-plugin-ttag` and `babel-cli` were updated to use the newest version of babel. There is some changes in how `babel` handles configs in the new version. You can look through this [issue](https://github.com/ttag-org/ttag-cli/issues/43) for the details. The details on how to upgrade to the new babel version is [here](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/v7-migration).

## _ is now a default alias for the gettext func
As it is a common scenario to use global `_` function for your translation workflow, we decided to add default alias for the [gettext](/docs/gettext.html) function. 

## Override default extract/update behavior for the ttag-cli
There were a couple of feature requests ([#39](https://github.com/ttag-org/ttag-cli/issues/39), [#46](https://github.com/ttag-org/ttag-cli/issues/46)) to have an ability to extend `babel-plugin-ttag` config with CLI arguments. So, now `ttag-cli update/check/extract/resolve` supports 2 new CLI options: `discover`, `numberedExpressions`.

> More about babel-plugin-ttag settings [here](/docs/plugin-api.html)

Usage Example:

For instance, previously, your translation workflow was relying on the global `_` function and you were using `xgettext` to extract translations. The new `ttag-cli` version will be able to recognize global `_` function by providing `discover` option to the update cmd (without explicit import or require).

```
ttag update --discover=_ my.po src/
```
